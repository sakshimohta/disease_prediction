# 🧠 Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting diseases based on user symptoms using machine learning algorithms. The aim is to build a basic healthcare assistance tool that can predict possible diseases given a list of symptoms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Healthcare is a vital domain where machine learning can make a big impact. This project utilizes patient symptoms to predict the most likely disease from a predefined list. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, processed and classified using various ML techniques.

## 📂 Files

- `Disease Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook where all the magic happens — data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- (Optional) `disease.csv`: Dataset used (you can link or add details here if it's not inside the repo).
